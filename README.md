#ABSTRACT 
Accurately forecasting students' academic performance is essential in the field of edu
cational analytics in order to provide early interventions and individualized learning 
support. The goal of this project is to create a prediction model that calculates a stu
dent's final grade by taking into account a number of academic and individual criteria, 
including study hours, attendance, parental education, class involvement  and prior 
grades.  
We trained a model that could predict continuous grades using a cleaned and prepro
cessed dataset using the supervised machine learning technique Linear Regres
sion.Performance indicators such as R2 Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root 
Mean Square Error (RMSE) were used to assess the model. 
Additionally, Streamlit was used to create a web-based user interface that lets users 
enter pertinent information and evaluate performance recommendations and expected 
results right away. This method shows how AI may be used practically in education 
and might help educators, learners and institutions monitor and enhance academic 
achievement.
