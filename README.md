## 📌 Project Objectives

- To analyze key factors influencing student performance.
- To develop a predictive model using linear regression.
- To visualize actual vs predicted student grades.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn
- **IDE/Platform**: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

---

## 📊 Dataset

- The dataset used is `student_data.csv`.
- It contains features like:
  - Hours of study
  - Attendance percentage
  - Assignment score
  - Internal marks
  - Final grade (target)

---

## 🔍 Approach

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Splitting data into training and testing sets
4. Model building using `LinearRegression()` from scikit-learn
5. Evaluation using:
   - R² Score
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
6. Visualization:
   - Actual vs Predicted Plot
   - Residual Plot
   - Distribution Plot

---

## 📈 Sample Output

- **R² Score**: *0.87* (example)
- **MSE**: *12.34* (example)
- **Predicted vs Actual** plot shows a close fit, indicating good model performance.
